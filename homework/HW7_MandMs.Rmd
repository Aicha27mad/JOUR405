---

In this assignment, you'll be picking up where you left off with the M&Ms activity. You'll load the data and perform some basic statistical analysis. Follow the steps below to complete the assignment.

### Task 1: Load the tidyverse
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


### Task 2: Load the M&Ms dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/mandms.csv
```{r}
MandMs <- read_csv ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/mandms.csv")
```


### Task 3: Sample 5 rows of data from the dataset, and then sample 10 rows, saving each to separate dataframes called sample5 and sample10.
```{r}
sample_5 <- MandMs|>
sample_n(100) 
sample_10 <- MandMs |> 
sample_n(100)
```

### Task 4: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the samples, using one of the colors.
```{r}
sample_5 |> summarize (mean = mean(red), sd =sd(red)) 

```



### Task 5: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the population, using the same color as Task 4
```{r}
MandMs|> summarize (mean = mean(red), sd =sd(red)) 
```


### Task 6: Compare the sample and population statistics

Compare the three sets of means and standard deviations. Are they similar?
Answer Here: Yes, they're each similar with the mean being 72.98 and the standard deviation being 16.45.

### Task 7: Describe the results

Write a few sentences about what you found in the data. What does this tell you about the M&Ms dataset and about the act of random sampling?
Answer Here: 


When finished, save your work, switch to GitHub Desktop, then add, commit and push your changes to GitHub and submit the URL of the notebook in ELMS.
